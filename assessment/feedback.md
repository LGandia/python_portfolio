*Complete the sections below to indicate what work you have completed. This will guide your marker. 
Your marker will leave a mark and feedback in this file.*

## 0. Practicals and Exercises

*Describe here the work that is in the ``practicals`` folder. Pay special attention
to any work you have included that is not taken from the sheets on MyBeckett. Write no more than 100 words.*

So far, practicals 1-5 have been completed. Each folder has an individual README with the tasks purposes.
Most of these tasks were completed with the aid of the online and live lectures, and on very rare occasion
a quick search on stack overflow / cheese shop (module libraries) documentations when it was indicated in the task.

As for the additional work folder, there are 3 different folders and one program.
- A2L website
- Alevel coursework
- GCSE coursework
- dcbot_clean (discord bot)

Both A-level and GCSE coursework folders have their own README files briefly explaining when they were performed, 
what grade was achieved and who it was marked by. The A2L folder shows a website I had to do for the Access to Leeds
module for Leeds University that was marked by David Ofili, and my grading sheet from Turnit in along with the grade 
boundaries.

As for the discord bot, it was a small project I decided to do back in 2021. I dared myself to program a discord bot
in one night while a friend was traveling back to their country. 
I did it using a YouTube guide with https://www.youtube.com/@James_S/videos being one of the main channels that I watched
for guidance.

## 1. Task 1: Pizza Prices

*Explain here how your "Pizza" programs works. Is it complete? Do you know of some bugs or errors? Be honest!
Write about 100 words.*

This program works correctly and does not have any bugs that I know of. It does not allow any invalid input into the
program, or a quantity of 0 for the amount of pizzas.
The program asks the user a series of questions to determine the total price of a pizza order, applying the
appropriate fees and discounts given in the README file for the task.

## 2. Task 2: The Cat Shelter

*Does this program work correctly? Please confirm if the file name is taken as a command-line argument. IS there
anything else your marker needs to know?*

This program works correctly and there are no known bugs to me. The program is run through the CLI and requires both
the program to be selected, and the file chosen to be run inside the program to be processed. 

i.e. ./cat_shelter.py cat_shelter_1.txt

## 3. Task 3: Managing Passwords

*Please indicate how much of this is completed. If it is incomplete, how much has been done? What does the marker
need to do in order to see how much you have done?*

Not yet completed, but the files for each bullet pointed task have been created. 
Only the adduser program has any writing in it.
