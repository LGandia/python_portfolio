# Week 3
## Task 1
Prompts the user for their name, if nothing is inputted then the program greets the user as stranger. 
Otherwise, they are greeted with the name that has been inputted

## Task 2
Asks the user to input a password, and to confirm it.
If the user's passwords do not match up the password is not set.

## Task 3
Same program as Task 2, but this time it checks that the password is 8-12 characters long (inclusive).
It will then jump to the previous program if the password is of the appropriate length. 
Otherwise, it will tell the user if the password is too long or too short.

## Task 4
A continuation of Task 2 and Task 3.
This time there is a list of common passwords that the user must not use.
The password will not be set if the password is on the list of bad passwords, or does not meet any of the requirements set above.

## Task 5
Another continuation of the above Tasks 2-4, this is Task 4 but instead of terminating whether the password is set or not, the program now only terminates if a valid password is entered and confirmed.

## Task 6
Program prints out the 7's timetables from 0-12

## Task 7
Prompts the user to say what tables they want to print. 
The program fails if the number inputted is too big or too small, otherwise it prints the desired number of timetables.

## Task 8
Continuation of Task 7, but it now prints the timetable downwards if a negative number is inputted.
