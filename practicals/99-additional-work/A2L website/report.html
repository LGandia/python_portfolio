        <h3>TOP THREE CHALLENGES IN INPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Using and creating Flexboxes</h4>

            Previously having very little experience with CSS and HTML it was a challenge to 
            tackle the implementation and use of flexboxes, and I am also not very good with object 
            oriented programing outside of the basics used in Pygame which was used in my A-level project.
            This created a big challenge as I was unsure how to set up the container and each individual box.</li>

            <li><h4>Placing and editing the footer</h4>

            In the resume, due to the invisible flexboxes, it was hard to find the right place to put the footer,
            as due to the different types of flex orders and wrappers I used, the footer would always shift to a
            different row or column than I intended. Another challenge with the footer was setting up a button that worked,
            and placing down the icons; all in the right place and alignment. I also found it particularly challenging
            to find a way to style the icons, and make both interactive with the lack of JavaScript</li>

            <li><h4>Adjusting the header to overlap with the image</h4>

            The flexboxes stop the header from being able to overlap with other elements, and taking the header 
            out of the flex container shifts the position of everything, similarly to the footer. However, unlike the footer, 
            by taking out the header from the container, it would cause it to size up significantly and also create a new row/column 
            and still not overlap with the elements I wished it did. This also caused the flexboxes under the heading to shift up and 
            the width of the boxes to decrease, making the text in education to overlap with each other.</li>

        <h3>HOW I MANAGED THE CHALLENGES</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Flexboxes</h4>

            Through a lot of research and analysing other people's codes, I was able to figure out how flexboxes 
            work and how to set them up so that they function how I want them to. After practicing a lot in a separate document
            with other information I had gathered from textbooks and guides, I started to become more confident with 
            the flexboxes and started to code the website. As mentioned above it was hard to place some elements on the website that
            didn't quite align with the flexboxes, but through a lot of trial and error I did manage to place everything where 
            I believe it should be.</li>

            <li><h4>Placing and editing the footer</h4>

            Through a lot of trial and error, and making small adjustments to figure out what affected the size
            and placement of the footer, I was able find the right settings and place for the footer. Another challenge along with this
            was the styling and interactional (hover features) of the icon. But after some trial and error, as well as doing some research
            I managed to find the right set of properties that needed to be given for the icons to be the right colour, as well as change 
            to be a different colour when hovered upon. This was a brand new thing for me to learn. Additionally, I found out that the 
            "button" tag could not have a link anchored to it, so I had to re-edit my code after validating it to create a brand new button 
            without it being an actual button, as to make it functional.</li>

            <li><h4>Adjusting the header to overlap with the image</h4>

            After a long time of researching I have managed to find the solution to the problem, by making the header's position absolute.
            However, this caused another wave of problems as mentioned above, since then the header was fixed at the top, and the rest of 
            the flexboxes would push up and shrink, with the contacts section being completely covered by the overlapping heading. 
            This was solved my first placing the header where I wanted it to be, by adding the right padding at the top, and then
             adding a top padding to the contacts section which allowed it to shuffle everything down. As for the shrinking, I opted to set
            the flex shrink to 0, which stops the flexbox from shrinking, rather than attempt to make it bigger (using grow) since it was 
            not working previously.</li>

        <h3>TOP THREE THINGS LEARNED DURING IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
        <ol>
            <li class="list_resume">A deeper understanding of Object Oriented Programing through CSS. As CSS and HTML was not taught to me during GCSEs, and 
            talking to some friends back in exam season, we had in total 3 lessons (1 hour per lesson) dedicated to CSS, HTML and JavaScript 
            in the whole 2 years of computing A-levels, which we agreed was not enough for us to pass a test, since after those three lessons at 
            the start of the year, we never re-visisted or revised HTML related content ever again. So the creation of this website was a big 
            challenge for me since I had never done anything like this before, and the most I could do on a HTML page previous to this was 
            setting up a link, an image and some default headings with a a CSS stylesheet that used no classes.</li>
            
            <li class="list_resume">Patience and determination when it comes to programing, and learning to take breaks. Usually for projects, I will sit down
            and tackle through each challenge given to me after some planning, and I will focus on this and only this for some time until I believe
            it is completed. However, this challenge was a lot harder for me, since the previous challenges I had completed where python related adding 
            and had a lot more guidance attached to it, as well as direct help and input from teachers and peers; which may also help cope with the 
            frustation of not getting something. So by this being an individual task, I had to learn when to stop and think things over when I got really 
            stuck on a problem, since I knew that by sitting there I was tired out and just get more frustated with the work.</li>

            <li class="list_resume">Overall, a further insight into when OOP (Object Oriented Programing) is used and why they must be used for programing purposes, 
            i.e. maintenance, compatibility, etc. This was something very rewarding for me; as mentioned before I found OOP really hard 
            during my A-levels and struggled to code it and understand it. And due to the initial teaching and practicing of OOP in python, 
            I was asking my teacher why is this useful since we are doing something that is fairly complicated but we can not do anything with it inside
            python. However, this later changed when it came to doing our project and this challenge, since you are putting the OOP practice in use, rather 
            than creating imaginary objects without a function or purpose.</li>
