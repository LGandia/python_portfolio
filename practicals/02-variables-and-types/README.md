### Fizz Buzz

"Fizz Buzz" is a popular children's counting game.

In it, players count incrementally, but any number that is exactly divisible by 3 is replaced with the word "Fizz", and any number that is exactly divisible by 5 is replaced with the word "Buzz". Numbers exactly divisible by both are replaced with "Fizz Buzz".

Write a program that prints the first 40 "numbers" in this game. It will start:

    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz

Commit your program to your repo.
