# Week 5
## Task 1
Using command-line arguments involves the sys module write a short program that when run
from the command-line reports what operating system platform is being used.

## Task 2
Write a program that, when run from the command line, reports how many
arguments were provided.

## Task 3
Write a program that takes a bunch of command-line arguments, and then prints
out the shortest. If there is more than one of the shortest length, any will do.

## Task 4
Write a program that takes a URL as a command-line argument and reports
whether there is a working website at that address.

## Task 5
Last week you wrote a program that processed a collection of temperature readings
entered by the user and displayed the maximum, minimum, and mean. Create a
version of that program that takes the values from the command-line instead. Be
sure to handle the case where no arguments are provided!

## Task 6
Write a program that takes the name of a file as a command-line argument, and
creates a backup copy of that file. The backup should contain an exact copy of the
contents of the original and should, obviously, have a different name.
